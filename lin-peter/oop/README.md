# Building Objects and Classes

Please use the code in start.py as a starting point.

## Changing Objects' Properties

Modify the code so that when we search for a method, we look in the
object before looking in its class (and parent classes) so that if
someone wants to override a method for a particular object (rather than
for an entire class) they can do so.

## Multiple Inheritance

Modify the code so that a class can have any number of parents.  Create
a simple example to show that this works, either by modifying the code
in start.py or by creating something new.

## Prototypes

Some languages don't distinguish between objects and classes. Instead,
we clone an existing object to create a new one, and then modify the new
one's properties. Every object remembers what it was cloned from, so
when we look up a method, we look at the chain of clones instead of the
chain of classes. Create a new file prototype.py and write functions
clone(), find(), and call() that do this. Do you find prototypes easier
or harder to understand than classes?

> I find the programming languages such as JavaScript that
> uses prototypes more difficult to understand 
> because I find classes useful when I try to make a high-level change.
