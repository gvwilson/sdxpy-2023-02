## File Types

The first eight bytes of a PNG image file always contain the following (base-10) values:

```
137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10
```

Write a program that determines whether a file is a PNG image or not.

## Converting Integers to Bits

Using Python's bitwise operators,
write a function that returns the binary representation of a non-negative integer.
Write another function that converts a string of 1's and 0's into an integer
(treating it as unsigned).
